        <h1>Website Portfolio Requirements</h1>
        <p>To conduct research on website portfolios, I visited two websites that provided valuable information on the topic. The first site was called “How to Build a Powerful Web Developer Portfolio (With Examples!)” and offered detailed guidance on creating a professional portfolio. The second site was called "The Anatomy of a Perfect Portfolio Website to Showcase Your Work " it had provided examples of effective portfolios contained. Both sites were informative and provided a wealth of knowledge to help me understand the importance of a portfolio in a professional setting. In this article we will discuss the important factors we should include in a website portfolio from your career path to your about page, case studies, testimonials, call to actions and to your work showcase. 
            <br><br>
            When creating your portfolio, it is important to consider what type of career you are interested in pursuing. Your portfolio should be tailored to your intended career. For example, my intended career is web design and development. If you are seeking a career in web design, your portfolio should showcase your web design skills and the projects you have worked on. If you are interested in a career in marketing, your portfolio should highlight your marketing accomplishments and any marketing campaigns you have managed. Your portfolio should also include a cover letter or a personal statement that highlights your skills and qualifications. 
            <br><br>
            In terms of information to include in your portfolio, there are several essential components to consider. You should have a section that demonstrates your skills and qualifications, such as your resume, your education, and any relevant certifications. You should also have a section that showcases your experience, such as previous work experience, volunteering or internships, and any relevant projects you have worked on. Finally, you should have a section that demonstrates your passion and interests, such as any hobbies or interests you have, as well as any awards or accomplishments you have received. 
            <br><br>
            In today's job market, prospective employers often look for well-rounded individuals who possess not only technical skills but also professional qualities such as communication, problem-solving, and team building. A portfolio is an excellent way to demonstrate these qualities and is an essential component of any job application. A well-crafted portfolio can set you apart from the competition and increase your chances of landing your dream job. </p>
