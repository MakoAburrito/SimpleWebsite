            Building this website has been an enlightening journey for me. It allowed me to dive deep into the world of web development, from structuring the HTML to styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript. Each step of the way presented its challenges, but overcoming them has been incredibly rewarding. I've learned not only technical skills but also gained a deeper understanding of design principles and user experience. Moreover, this project has given me a tangible showcase of my abilities, which I believe will greatly benefit my career. It serves as both a portfolio piece and a testament to my dedication and skills in web development. I'm excited about the potential opportunities that may arise from sharing this website with potential employers or clients, and I look forward to continuing to refine and expand upon it as I further my career in web development.

            Although at first this project started off as a project created to make another persons portfolio. I still will find alot of benefit using what i learned and fixed it to create my own portfolio. I think the greatest thing i have learned from this class was more on form creation and on github repos. Giving me alot more skills into creating a website and how to repo it.

            From the initial stages of planning and conceptualization to the final touches of optimization and debugging, every step can present its unique challenges. One of the most common struggles is finding the right balance between functionality and aesthetics. It's essential to ensure that the website not only looks visually appealing but also functions seamlessly across different devices and browsers.
            <br>
            Some problems of the website are currently with the timing i had to cut some corners by some links not going to a website just yet and the site not looking as asethically full as it should. Because of the limited time i came up with designs on the spot and not everything is the same as my proposed wireframe.
